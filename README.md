### hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eric, but most people call me Shreve. 

I write a lot of code now, but it wasn't always this way. Before I settled into software engineering I worked as an Instacart shopper, a bookseller at Barnes & Noble in a mall, numerous solo all day shifts at a small drycleaners, then I accidentally worked for a company where the business model was just to do fraud (only for 3 weeks), and as a Tier 1 tech support rep for a small privately owned internet service provider that operated primarily in central valley of California.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on all sorts of projects, from TUI games like blackjack and tic-tac-toe, to a twitter bot that randomly tweets quotes from old CW shows.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all about Docker, I recently configured my NAS to run a whole bunch of Docker containers to automate my _not media torrenting_. And then just for fun, spun up 3 more containers to collect and display metrics on all the _other_ containers.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Golang, theater audio and lighting, Python, Star Trek, or the nuances behind big rig trucking routes.
